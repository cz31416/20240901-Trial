git clone "{website}"
cd
ls -la

git status: check status
If we get "fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git", then type "git init" then it should work
If we get "modified: {file}", then maybe there are cached data, so type "git rm --cached -r ."

git add .: adds files that are about to be committed
git commit -m "{some text}": commits file with input message using -m
QUESTION: where do we see these messages?
ANSWER: in the GitHub repository
QUESTION: what happens to the files added and committed to the wrong folder?
NOTE: when file is modified, can do "git add ." and "git commit -m "{message}"" again to commit the file

Using vim {file name}, we can access the text file and write in it by typing i for insert mode, then esc to exit insert mode, then :wq to write and quit. This will save the changes through vim into the text file directly.
